# Rust enums

```

Enums in Rust are a powerful feature that allows you to define a type that can take on one of several possible variants. This concept can be likened to the principles of quantum physics, where particles exist in multiple states until observed. Below is an explanation of Rust enums, followed by a comparison to quantum states

```

### Basic Definition

```

An enum (short for "enumeration") in Rust is a data type that can represent one of several variants. Each variant can optionally hold data. For example, you might define an enum to represent different types of shapes:

```

#### Enums and Quantum Physics Analogy

```

In quantum physics, particles such as electrons exist in superposition, meaning they can be in multiple states at once until measured. This concept mirrors how enums operate in Rust:
Superposition of States: Just as a quantum particle can exist in multiple states simultaneously, an enum can represent multiple variants. However, only one variant is active at any given time when you work with it in code.
Measurement and Observation: In quantum mechanics, observing a particle forces it into one of its possible states. Similarly, when you use pattern matching with enums in Rust (like using the match statement), you are effectively "observing" which variant is currently being used and acting accordingly.
Deterministic Outcomes: Once a quantum state is observed, it collapses into a definite state. In Rust, once you match against an enum variant, you are guaranteed to handle that specific case, ensuring that your program behaves predictably without ambiguity.
